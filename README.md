## Acknowledgements

This idea is from project based on the course [Next.js: Dev to Deployment](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-dev-to-deployment/) by Brad Traversy. This course will also helpfully walk you through some of the more complicated steps of getting the project deployed with Heroku (backend) and Vercel (frontend).
